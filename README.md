# Sleep_drug_bayesian_analysis
A study was done testing the efficacy of three different drugs for the use as sleep aids. The study was conducted by medical professionals Arthur Cushny and Roy Peebles. The researches tested the drugs laevorotatory hyoscyamine, laevorotatory hyoscine, and racemic hyoscine on a group of 10 separate patients at the Michigan Asylum for insane at Kalamazoo. First, each patient had their normal average amount of sleep recorded. The journal states, "a tablet was given on each alternate evening, and the duration of sleep and other features noted and compared with those of the interviewing control night on which no hypnotic was given. Hyoscyamine was thus used on three occasions, and then racemic hyoscine, and then laevo-hyoscine. Then a tablet was given each evening for a week or more, the different alkaloids following each other in succession." \footnote{Cushny &amp; Peebles 1905 509}. Using Bayesian analysis, we will analyze the outcome of this study to determine the how effective each drug is at aiding in sleeping.
